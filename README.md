I have developed a simple GUI application that serves as a code line manager using Python's Tkinter library. This application enables users to manage lines of code easily by allowing them to add, edit, delete, and rearrange lines as needed. One of the standout features of this application is its ability to handle indentation automatically, making it particularly useful for programming languages where indentation is syntactically significant, such as Python. With this tool, I aim to streamline the coding process, providing an intuitive interface that enhances productivity.

The application is built around three main classes: CodeLineManager, LanguageMenu, and CodeBuilderGUI. The CodeLineManager class is responsible for managing the lines of code, keeping track of indentation levels, and providing methods to manipulate the lines of code. Users can add new lines, remove existing ones, and even rearrange them as needed. The add_line method intelligently adjusts indentation based on whether the previous line ends with a colon, which is particularly helpful for maintaining proper structure in Python code. This focus on indentation management reflects my attention to detail and understanding of coding standards.

The second class, LanguageMenu, allows users to select the language in which they want to work. This is particularly useful for those who prefer to use the application in their native language, as it supports a variety of languages, including English, French, German, and Spanish. By using a dropdown menu, users can easily choose their preferred language, and the application will adapt accordingly. This feature not only makes the application more accessible but also enhances the user experience by catering to a diverse audience.

The heart of the application lies in the CodeBuilderGUI class, which constructs the main interface for user interaction. The GUI consists of a text area for code input, a line number display, and several buttons for performing various actions such as adding or deleting lines. Additionally, the GUI includes options for automatic indentation, allowing users to enable or disable this feature according to their preferences. I designed the interface to be user-friendly, ensuring that all features are easily accessible without overwhelming the user. The integration of scrollbars for both vertical and horizontal scrolling further enhances usability, especially when dealing with long lines of code or extensive projects.

Finally, I have included essential functionalities like code execution, saving, and pasting code from the clipboard. Users can run their code directly within the application, which adds a layer of convenience as they can see the results instantly. Furthermore, the ability to copy and paste code seamlessly allows for a more efficient workflow, making it easier for users to manage their code snippets. Overall, this application embodies my vision of creating a helpful tool for programmers that simplifies the coding process while ensuring that best practices, such as proper indentation and line management, are upheld. Through continuous development and user feedback, I hope to enhance this application further, making it an indispensable tool for developers of all skill levels.
